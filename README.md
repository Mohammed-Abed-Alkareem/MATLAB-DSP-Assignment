# MATLAB-DSP-Assignment

## Description
This assignment, created for the ENCS4310 - Digital Signal Processing (DSP) course at Birzeit University, focuses on using MATLAB to analyze and process various signals. The tasks include plotting signal spectrums, analyzing convolution outputs, and examining filter effects through pole-zero diagrams and frequency response plots.

## Objectives
- Plot and analyze the magnitude and phase spectrums of signals using FFT.
- Compare convolution of signals with multiplication in the frequency domain.
- Investigate filter characteristics using pole-zero diagrams and frequency response plots.
- Apply the designed filter to a sample signal and evaluate its effect.

### Contents
- MATLAB scripts for signal processing tasks.
- Detailed comments and explanations within the code for better understanding.
- Plots and diagrams generated during the assignment.
